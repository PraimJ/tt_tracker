//NOTES ARE MADE FOR THE FLOW OF THE CODE//

//imported Head, We expose a built-in component for appending elements to the head of the page:
//useRouter = If you want to access the router object inside any function component in your app, you can use the useRouter hook, take a look at the following example:
//MongoClient is used to fetch the data from database
//we are giving props from NewPlayerForm Component (onAddPlayer)

//if you have to use router, make it a const in the start of the function
//when onAddPlayer function is active on the NewPlayerForm component, it calls the addPlayerHandler function.
//addPlayerHandler take an argument called enteredPlayerData which is the data sent from newplayerForm component. 
//response fetches the api of api/new-player, it calls a method of post, the body is enteredPlayerData
//data = is the response that is posted
//router.push(‘/‘), after the game is posted than it send back to the indexes page
